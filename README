MAT - Memory Analysis Tool
--------------------------

This simple script takes as input a memory dump and a description file describing that memory section and produces an output describing the contents.

The description file is written in YAML and the example (default.map) should be self-explanatory. This includes some registers from a processor peripheral.

There is an example memory dump and output created using default.map. It was created by running 

python src/mat.py -i example.dat > example.txt

For other parameters, run the script with the -h option.

You only need to describe the bits that you are interested in in the definition file. The worflow I use is:
- I run the software to just before something interesting happens to the memory section.
- I dump the memory region to a file.
- I run the code that causes the changes.
- I dump the memory region to another file.
- Then I run the script on the two files and use Beyond Compare to see what was changed.

Very handy for complex peripherals and large memory sections.

The value of each bit range is shown in bit, hex and integer plus if the value is exactly 8 bits, also the corresponding ASCII character.
